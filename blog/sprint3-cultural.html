                  <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

                  <div class="definition">
                    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                    <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify your own emotions and those of others, to self-motivate ourselves and know how to monitor our emotions and those of the people around us. Emotional intelligence consists of around 5 key aspects; Self awareness, Self management, Social skills, Empathy and motivation.</p>

                  <div class="difference">
                      <h3>How is different to IQ?
                      </h3>
                    <p>Emotional intelligence EQ is much different but I say as important if not more than the general intelligence IQ. Emotional intelligence allows you to keep your personal well being in check and also understand the people around you. Every sort of intelligence signals an ability to navigate well around a particular set of challenges; mathematical, linguistic commercial. When we say someone is clever but have also made a mess of their lives, or have acquired a fortune but are lonely and sad. This is pointing to deficit of what is called emotional intelligence.</p>

                <div class="importance">
                    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                    <p>The reason why I believe emotional intelligence is so important is the effects it has on your own well being and the relationships you establish with the people around you. Emotional intelligence has proven to help in the work environment even more so than general intelligence. You may have the skills required for the job, but if your personality doesn't mesh well with the others in the work environment you most likely arenâ€™t going to be a good fit. Compared to someone with less skills but gets along well with others at work.</p>
