                    <h3>Long term goal and career pathway?</h3>
                    <p>My goal is to graduate/finish EDA’s bootcamp knowing that I put everything into it and came out with as much knowledge and skills that I possibly could. Career wise i’m still no 100% which area but at the moment I think front-end development is the best path for me with my creative background. I’m wanting to land a solid job in the tech industry after finishing bootcamp. Long term I would like to get to a position where I can work part-time and still live comfortably, so I can work on both my art and web dev.</p>

                    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
                    <p>I’d say my people skills are already pretty decent with working in hospo for 2+ years. Other skills that I would like to see developed would be leadership skills, although I don’t like being the leader. I think it would be a good skill to have for moving up in a work environment.</p>

This should include - an explantion of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representitives.</h3>
                    <p>I will be managing this workload, by using apps to manage my time for example toggle. Will be tackling my memory problem with writing reflections, and physical notes during bootcamp. For attention span I will take small breaks example pomodoro technique, so I don’t overwhelm myself . I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry.community representatives. With to-do lists and good communication.</p>
