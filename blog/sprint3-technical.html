    <div class="analogy">
        <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
        <p>An analogy describing the differences between HTML and CSS could be. House. Html is like the bare bones of the house, empty. Then css comes along and we can call the css an interior designer even. They come in and make our house/HTML look amazing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="control">
        <h3>Control Flow & Loops</h3>
        <p>Control Flow is the order in which code is run. An example would be drawing a picture. First you need to grab your book/paper, then your pen and then you can start drawing. You would not be able to start/execute your drawing without a pen or a paper. This is what makes control flow important</p>
        
        <p>Loops are a conditional statement that runs a piece of code over and over again until  the condition is false. An example would be drinking coffee. You will 'take sip of coffee' for as long as the coffee cup has coffee in it (coffee > empty) take sip,you will repeat take sip until coffee is equal to empty you will stop taking sips.     </p>
    </div>

    <div class="functions">
        <h3>Functions & Why They Are Useful</h3>
        <p>Functions are a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is executed when "something" invokes it. Functions are awesome because it allows us to reuse code. Define the code once and use it as many times as you want. You can also use the same functions but with different arguments, this produces different results. This is great because it saves you a lot of time and also makes your code look cleaner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="arrays">
      <h3>Accessing Data From Arrays and Objects</h3>
      <p>An array is a single variable that contains multiple values and is used to store different elements. For example <b>var cars = ['Nissan', 'Toyota', 5];</b>. As you can see the values do not have to be of the same type.When accessing an array you do so by referring to the index number of that array. Example, <b>var name = cars[1];</b> would equal <b>Toyota</b>. (note [0] is the first element. [1] is the second.).
      </p>
      <p>  An object is a collection of properties, and property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. An example of an object is a plate. A plate is an object, with properties. A plate has a colour, shape, weight and material, etc. The same way Javascript objects have properties which define their characteristics. <b>var plate {colour: 'red' shape: 'circle' weight: 3kg }</b> is an example of an object. When accessing an value from an object it is different than accessing a value from an array. For an object we use <b>objectName.key (plate.colour = red)</b>.
      </p>
  </div>

    <div class="DOM">
        <h3>The DOM</h3>
        <p>The DOM, DOM stands for Document Object Module. The DOM is the glue that ties HTML, CSS & Javascript together. The DOM allows us to edit and manipulate both HTML and CSS through Javascript alone. When the browser takes your document, it converts all your HTML attributes and their values into Nodes/objects. With these turned into objects it allows us to edit and manipulate our HTML via Javascript. For example you using .js file to manipulate html you can use <b>document.getElementById('id') = x</b>. This would change that html attribute through javascript only, you don't have to actually go into the html file at all.
