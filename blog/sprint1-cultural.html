        <div class="myValues">
            <h3>My core personal values:</h3>
            <p>I would say my core values would be something along the lines of Kindness, Reliability, Resourcfulness and Optimism.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="decision1">
            <h3>Ethical decision I've made</h3>
            <p>An ethical decision I've had to make is I was walking home one day and found a big dog come up to me to play but no owner was around. As I carried on walking home hoping he would find his own way back home, but he continued to follow. I checked to see if he had a tag which he did so I was able to take him back to the house and carry on my way home after. Back then I used to be quite shy and like to keep to myself, but my value of kindness didn't want to leave the dog out in the open where there was a chance it could get hurt by a car. The consequence of this action was a peaceful mind for the journey home.</p>

        <div class="culture">
            <h3>How my culture has influenced my values and identity.</h3>
            <p>Culture is a way of life here in Aotearoa, a crock pot of different cultures from all around the world. Mixed together to 
                produce us Kiwi's. It is a set of shared values, goals and practices that we all share. Put simply, my culture is who I am. It is embedded in my beliefs and my memories. Growing up as a Kiwi, as a Maori and someone who looks to other cultures for inspiration. I can honestly say that I am a man with strong family values, respectful, integral, a man who like so many in Aotearoa pushes to do the right thing. Hard working, like my father, kind, like my mother, eager to learn and strive for greatness.

        <div class="strengths">
            <h3>My strengths and limitations in terms of my learning and career devlopment</h3>
            <p>My strengths are being; Resourcefulness, Creativism, Willingness to learn, and Optimism. I believe these will help me greatly through my learning and career development. I think that all of these strengths will be helpful to get me through what is described to be a tiring and draining learning process which is the Bootcamp of EDA. All though it's described as such I still can’t wait to get through this foundation material and start the bootcamp down in wellington. My limitations probably would be, staying focused and getting disheartened. I’ve always had trouble keeping focus as I grow up, not because I get distracted easily but I tend to zone out if i'm doing one thing for a long amount of time. Then being disheartened as an artist I love to look at other people's art for inspiration  but I will often compare it to my work and think I'm not good enough. However. I believe my strengths far outweigh my limitations for my learning journey and career development and am eager to eliminating these limitations.

        <div class="strengths2">
            <h3>Strengths that might help me in my learning journey and intersect with learning obstacles</h3>
            <p>My optimism should help me to keep my energy levels and mind in a good place to keep on learning and taking in all the information that is being thrown at us. It will also be useful in stressful group/individual situations as close deadlines or tough problems as I will be able to keep up moral and keep the workflow going. </p>

        <div class="strats">
            <h3>Example of experience where I was trying to work productively with others, but there was tension. My strategies used, how effective they were and my reflections on what I would do now, and why.</h3>
            <p>I was in a group project of 5 or so people in my last course, where we needed to collaborate all our creative ideas together to come up with one final one to work on. In this group were many different personalities and the extroverted people quickly took control of the process and I could see the introverts were opposed to some of the ideas but to shy to speak out. Knowing this I spoke to some of the people next to me to ask for their honest opinion and then voiced it to the group and then got them to chime in there ideas. I believe this was an effective strategy because I think I gave the person a spot for them to say what they wanted to and they were able to contribute to the team and were pleased. Strategies I would try now would probably be a little more straight-foward telling the people dictating over the group project to take a step back and let others voice their opinions.</p>
