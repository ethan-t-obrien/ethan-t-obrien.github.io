                    <h3>Blocked by Simple Problem</h3>
                    <p>During one of the javascript kata exercises, I was at a stump. I was glaring at this piece of code going over and over it again with my eyes trying to see if i've inputed something incorrect. I just had no idea why it was working, my function just wasn't running at all. After having a break I decided to look at similar function i've done before and noticed it was that something was missing and not wrong. I merely forgot to add 'return function'. This made be both happy and mad, happy that I passed the test finaly, but mad that it was such a simple error. From this i've learnt that I need to read errors more clearly and return my functions. 
                    </p>

                      <h3>When I Solved a Proble Elegantly
                      </h3>
                    <p>JS Gradebook was a rather difficult exercise. However the first test, which at first I thought I was gonna struggle.I needed to input an object into another object then link a different object into the correct key. I actually understood the resources and my research for the question which led me to pass the test without having to spend hours on it, or asking for help. This made me feel like i'm slowly starting to get my herad around Javascript.
                    </p>
                   
                    
                </div>

                <div class="problemSolving">
                  <h3>My Problem Solving Techniques
                  </h3>
                  <p>Pseudocode: I think i'm alright with this method 7/10. I can be pretty bad at wording things sometimes, so I have posibilty of confusing myself later on if I write my pseudocode badly.
                  </p> 

                  <p>Trying something: 10/10 This method is me. However i've been told by my facilator Jos$eph that it looks like im just taking a stab at trial and error, but not actually thinking about what i'm trying. So now i'm trying to go at my problems with more informed stabs. I believe this will help me greatly and stop me from going down wrong paths and wasting time.
                  </p>

                  <p>Rubber Ducky: I use this method when I'm at a point where I just don't know what to do. I can't say it's helped yet but I think it will start working once my brain gets more used to Javascript language, and terms. 5/10
                  </p>

                  <p>Reading Errors: I'd say pretty confident 8/10. I generally can underastand what the error message is trying to tell me. But sometimes I can take the message the wrong way and then take away working code. Which is not good.
                  </p>

                  <p>Console.loggin: I try and use this a lot, as like to see what my code is doing. But sometimes it doesn't work, I think i'm just logging the wrong information or im logging something that is broken. I would really like to get better at this as I feel its a staple of Javascript. 7/10
                  </p>

                  <p>Googling: I do this a lot 10/10. This is probably my most used method in problem solving. I look at the functions that i'm supposed to be creating and try find something that tells me how it works so I can use it on my won. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Asking peers for help: 8/10. I do this when i'm at a complete halt in my code and have no idea what else I can do to make this code work. I try not to do it to much as I don't want to take up other peoples time when they are trying to work on their own stuff.
                  </p>

                  <p>Asking Coah: 10/10 This is another last resort method. I hit up my facilator when I have no idea what i need to do to make my code work. Or if i'm not understanding a concept of what we are trying to learn. This is good as I can get a great explanation which usually ends up with me understanding what I need too.
                  </p>

                  <p>Improving process with reflection: hmm 7/10. I think it's somewhat helpful and i've been keeping up with my reflections which is a first for me. I think it does help me retain more information as I go back over what I've done for the day. I think it will help if I start reflecting over the more practical parts of coding from the day.
                  </p>
