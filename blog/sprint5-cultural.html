                    <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of core learning?</h3>
                    <p>
                     I think I have a quite high emotional intelligence level. I already believed in growth mindest before I researched it. That I need to have a solid learning plan and that time managment is going to be the key factor to my success in this course.
                    </p>
                   

                  </div>

                  <div class="q2">
                      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programing.</h3>

                    <p>
                      Values are there to help you out and keep you going even though the learning process is going to be dificult. Empathy for this is a cohort and not just youself and I will be working in team environments so I need to be thinking of my peers and not just myself. Self awareness, need to keep an eye on myself so I don't burn myself or become ill.
                    </p>
                </div>

                  <h3>What has suprised you the most about core learning</h3>

                <p>
                  How much core learning content there was included in the foundations. Before starting I assumed that it would just be heavy on the coding and tech side to get us prepared. But it makes sense now that i've done the foundations that there was so much content on core learning.

                <br>

                <div class="q4">
                  <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning</h3>

                <p>
                  Talking about identity,values and strengths. I'm not the best at putting things into words and writing. So I think this was the most challenging aspect of core learning.
                </p>

                  <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>

                <p>
                  Because how important it is to be able to work effectively in a team in environment. Which is most likely the case for development jobs.
                </p>

                <div class="q6">
                  <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

                <p>
                  No, I don't think it's a waste of time, because in my last studies Animation. There were lots of time we spent focusing on developing out soft skills. We did this because it is crucial to be able to explain ideas in the creative industry. I think it applies to the tech industry as well.
