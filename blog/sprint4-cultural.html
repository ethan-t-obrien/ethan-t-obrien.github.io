                  <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>

                  <div class="neuro">
                    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
                    <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to change continuisly throughout an individuals life. </p>
                    <p>Neuroplasticity benefits people in a great way. Getting someone to understand neuroplasticity is like taking off the chains on their brain. The chains are  telling them they can't do this, or I'm not good at this and I never will be so I won’t even try. With the chains now off, they will no longer be thinking of the negatives when a challenge difficult challenge confronts them. They now can attack the challenge with the mindset of being able to pass it, and if not now then eventually. Never can’t.</p>
                    <p>I engage with neuroplasticity daily. Whenever i’m working on coding, for example back when I was in highschool I didn’t really like code as I didn’t understand it easily, this led to me thinking coding just wasn’t for me. But now that I have an interest, enjoy code and actually want to learn, I'm taking in the information a lot better and feel like im making huge progress.</p>
                    <p>The easiest ways to increase neuroplasticity is repetition. Repeating an activity, is the best way to get more proficient. By repeating the activity we are getting our brains used to accessing and retrieving that certain memory. Constantly doing this helps to build thicker, stronger and more hard-wired connections in the brain.</p>
                    <p>Here is a resource that I found really helpful for explain neuroplasticity.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g (Neuroplasticity) straightforward explanations and visual animations to make understanding neuroplasticity easy. </p>

                      <h3>Growth Mindset
                      </h3>
                    <p>A growth mindset is when a person knows that there is no fixed talent or limitations place upon them and others. With this mindset it enables the person to be able to give effort into their activities or study knowing their skills will develop and grow.</p>
                    <p>I knew a fair bit about the growth mindset before this exploration just not the term "growth mindset'. I found it interesting in the 10min video about the school using the term NY (not yet) in place of fail. As it will be far more positive and let the student know that they don't have it but can still achieve it. </p>
                    <p>If i'm ever struggling or not understanding a certain area of the bootcamp which I'm sure will happen given how intense the bootcamp is said to be. I'll make sure to keep the growth mindset in mind as it takes time to understand complex things and that I'll get it eventually with enough practice or time.</p>
